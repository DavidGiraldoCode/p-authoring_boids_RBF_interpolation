# Interactive authoring of boids with steering behaviors for video games

**Status:** </br>
I am currently working on a derivative of Craig Reynolds's 1987 paper: "Flocks, herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model," as my final project for the course DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Current questions for interactive authoring

1. What are the use cases of authoring Boids? The path of the geomtric flight?
2. What variables should be expose to the designer to achieve a desired outcome?
3. Should avoiding obstacles be a default behaviour? 

Features road map

| Backlog | Doing | Implemented | OutOfScope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dynamic acceleration requests |  | Separation, Alignment and Cohesion Forces | Field of view |
| Obstacle avoidance |  | Flock bounding box  |  |
| Banking |  |  |  |
| Space Partitioning |  |  |  |
