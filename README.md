# Interactive authoring of boids for video games using Radial Basis Functions (RBF)

**ðŸš§ I am currently working on my final project for the course DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.**

How do we interpolate when there is no grid? Having no sample grid is a scattered data problem for which traditional linear interpolation does not suffice. Thus, Radial Basis Functions exist as a solution for this problem by defining a function capable of interpolating any given discrete value in space, given all the values at source points.

$$
S(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i \phi(||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i||), \quad \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d.
$$

The Radial Basis function Î¦(x) Phi is determined by the Euclidean distance formula and a kernel, which can be changed depending on the desired outcome.

$$
\Phi(r) = ||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i||
$$

```csharp
double Phi(Vector3 vector_j, Vector3 vector_i) //RBF
{
    Vector3 distance = vector_j - vector_i;
    float r = distance.magnitude;
    double GSkernel = Math.Exp(-0.001 * Math.Pow(r, 2)); //Gaussian (GS)
    double Skernel = r;  //Spline (S)
    return Skernel;
}
```

Jin (2009) presented an application of crow authoring relaying on path-planning components. They incorporated radial basis function interpolation of vector fields to guide pedestrians' flow in a grid-less setup.

I am implementing and applying their paper to author the flow of a flock of boids.

## More about crowd simulations

Representing multiple living entities in a virtual world has been one task that entices computer graphics practitioners, from movies and video games to urban planning and architecture. This is a branch of computer graphics animation called crow simulation. Crowd simulation is about representing non-verbal behaviors of virtual agents and their relations with their environment and others, characterized by the change of position of entities over time (Colas 2022). 

Lemonari (2022) categorizes the components that encompass crowd simulation and the aspects that can be authored into six categories: Hih-level behaviors, path-planning, local movements, bony animation, visualization, and post-processing.
